# Snake Game in Free Pascal (Linux, ncurses)

A small, retro‑style Snake game written in **Free Pascal** using **ncurses**.  
Built as a fun 15‑minute project to show that Pascal is still clean, capable, and enjoyable.

This project also reflects three pillars I care about:

### **1. Project Builds**  
A complete, visual program you can compile and run immediately.

### **2. Engineering Wisdom**  
Under the surface, Snake teaches fundamentals used in real systems:  
state updates, event loops, deterministic logic, boundary checks, and input handling.

### **3. Developer Well‑Being**  
Sometimes a tiny retro game is the perfect distraction — a few minutes of fun that reminds us why we started coding in the first place.
